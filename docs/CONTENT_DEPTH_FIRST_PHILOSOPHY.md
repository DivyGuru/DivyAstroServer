# Content-Depth-First Ingestion Philosophy

**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE  
**Applies to**: ALL astrology books

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**"Extract maximum usable astrology knowledge, even if confidence is low, and express uncertainty via language, not by rejection."**

This is a **CONTENT-DEPTH-FIRST** system.
- DO NOT be over-strict
- DO NOT discard usable knowledge
- Extract maximum usable content
- Express uncertainty via language, not rejection

---

## ❌ ABSOLUTE RULES

### NEVER discard content just because:
- ❌ confidence is medium or low
- ❌ wording is vague
- ❌ meaning is implied, not explicit

### Discard ONLY when:
- ✅ No astrology signal exists
- ✅ Pure philosophy / poetry
- ✅ No planet / house / yoga / remedy / timing reference

### LOW confidence ≠ REJECT
**LOW confidence → softer language:**
- "may indicate"
- "often associated with"
- "can sometimes suggest"

---

## 📋 INGESTION FLOW (MANDATORY)

### PHASE 1 — SCAN EVERYTHING
- Detect ALL of the following:
  - BASE (Planet × House)
  - NAKSHATRA
  - DASHA
  - TRANSIT
  - STRENGTH
  - YOGA
  - REMEDY
- **Nothing is filtered here.**

### PHASE 2 — UNDERSTANDING (NOT TRANSLATION)
- Use your OWN astrology knowledge
- Do NOT rely on keyword-only logic
- Understand:
  • what is affected
  • how it manifests
  • when it applies
  • what kind of intensity

**If meaning is partial:**
- Mark confidence = low or medium
- **Still KEEP it**

### PHASE 3 — ENGLISH REWRITE (CRITICAL)
- Rewrite like a human astrologer explaining
- NEVER generic templates like:
  ❌ "can be associated with constructive influences"
- Explain:
  • planet nature
  • house meaning
  • combined effect

**Example GOOD:**
> "Jupiter in the first house often supports wisdom, public respect, and a tendency toward ethical leadership, though results may vary based on overall chart strength."

### PHASE 4 — LAYER CLASSIFICATION (SOFT)
For EACH meaning:
- Try to attach ALL applicable layers:
  - BASE → always if planet+house
  - STRENGTH → dignity, retrograde, own sign
  - YOGA → combinations (even loosely stated)
  - DASHA → if timing is implied (not only explicit)
  - TRANSIT → if temporary nature is mentioned
  - NAKSHATRA → if star influence is implied

**If unsure:**
- Attach layer with LOW confidence
- DO NOT leave layer empty unnecessarily

### PHASE 5 — REMEDY EXTRACTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Lal Kitab & classical texts are REMEDY RICH
- Extract remedies EVEN IF:
  - wording is symbolic
  - remedy is indirectly suggested

For each remedy:
- Understand PURPOSE
- Link to problem/domain
- Set confidence (high/medium/low)
- **Never reject only due to uncertainty**

**Example:**
> "Feeding animals is suggested"
> → VALID remedy
> → confidence: medium
> → effect: stabilizing

### PHASE 6 — DATASET PREPARATION
- Convert EVERYTHING usable into datasets:
  - rules.v1.json
  - remedies.v1.json

**Confidence handling:**
- High → strong wording
- Medium → balanced wording
- Low → cautious wording

**NOTHING is discarded unless meaningless.**

### PHASE 7 — VERIFICATION
Check ONLY:
- ✅ English-only
- ✅ No fear language
- ✅ No absolute guarantees
- ✅ Layer tagging exists

**Do NOT reduce dataset size here.**

### PHASE 8 — INGESTION (FINAL)
- Ingest rules AND remedies together
- Preserve confidence levels
- Preserve source_book
- Idempotent behavior

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME

- ✅ Hundreds of rules (not tens)
- ✅ Dozens / hundreds of remedies
- ✅ Rich BASE layer
- ✅ STRENGTH & YOGA dominance
- ✅ Some DASHA / TRANSIT even if soft
- ✅ System becomes DEEP, not thin
- ✅ User gets real astrology content

---

## 📝 CONFIDENCE LANGUAGE MAPPING

### HIGH Confidence:
- "tends to support"
- "often indicates"
- "typically reflects"

### MEDIUM Confidence:
- "may support"
- "can indicate"
- "often associated with"

### LOW Confidence:
- "may sometimes indicate"
- "can occasionally suggest"
- "might be associated with"
