**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Summary

---

## Completed Refinements

### ✅ Saturn in 6th House

**Before:**
- Tone: informational
- Intensity: 0.5
- Message: "can be associated with a stronger focus on service, responsibilities, and health management"

**After:**
- Tone: cautionary
- Intensity: 0.65
- Message: "can create sustained pressure in health management, where throat, respiratory, and digestive health require greater attention and care. Back pain may be a recurring concern, and childhood injuries may require careful management. If unmanaged, these health areas may lead to ongoing challenges."

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Communicates specific health pressure areas
- ✅ States recurring concerns clearly
- ✅ Uses "if unmanaged, may lead to" (truthful, not fatalistic)
- ✅ Maintains capability mention

### ✅ Saturn in 8th House

**Before:**
- Tone: informational
- Intensity: 0.5
- Trend: mixed
- Message: "can correlate with more complex patterns around transformation and shared resources"

**After:**
- Tone: cautionary
- Intensity: 0.7
- Trend: down
- Message: "can create significant health risk requiring ongoing management, where respiratory, skin, heart, digestive, and blood-related health issues may require sustained attention. Relationship dynamics with siblings and relatives can create unnecessary tension, requiring greater effort to maintain harmony. If unmanaged, health challenges may lead to ongoing difficulties."

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Communicates specific health risk areas
- ✅ States relationship pressure clearly
- ✅ Uses "if unmanaged, may lead to" (truthful consequence)
- ✅ Maintains actionable guidance

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (Challenging Placements):
- [ ] Saturn in 7th house (partnership pressure)
- [ ] Saturn in 12th house (expenditure/isolation)
- [ ] Mars in 6th, 8th, 12th houses

## Next Steps

1. **Systematic Review:**
   - Read original book text for each challenging placement
   - Assess current rule language
   - Refine to communicate pressure/risk/responsibility
   - Update tone, intensity, and trend as needed

2. **Validation:**
   - Does it create awareness without panic?
   - Would it motivate remedy engagement?
   - Is it truthful to the book's message?

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update this status document as refinements are completed
   - Note any patterns or insights discovered
