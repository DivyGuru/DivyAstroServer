# PHASE 1: Planet × House Rule Refinement Guidance

**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Purpose:** Refine rules to communicate pressure, risk, and responsibility without fear-based language

---

## Core Principles

### What Rules Should Communicate:

1. **PRESSURE** where pressure exists
   - "can create sustained pressure"
   - "requires greater effort"
   - "may require ongoing attention"

2. **RISK** where risk exists
   - "can create significant health risk"
   - "may lead to setbacks if unmanaged"
   - "requires careful handling"

3. **RESPONSIBILITY** where responsibility exists
   - "requires greater attention and care"
   - "demands careful management"
   - "needs sustained effort"

### What Rules MUST NOT Do:

- ❌ Use threatening language ("will destroy", "guaranteed failure")
- ❌ Make absolutist claims ("always", "never", "must")
- ❌ Create fear-based wording ("terrible", "disastrous", "catastrophic")
- ❌ Soften genuine challenges artificially
- ❌ Dilute warnings into meaningless neutrality

### Allowed Phrasing Style:

✅ "may experience difficulty"  
✅ "can create pressure"  
✅ "requires greater effort"  
✅ "if unmanaged, may lead to setbacks"  
✅ "may require ongoing attention"  
✅ "needs careful handling"

This is **truthful seriousness**, not fear.

## Refinement Examples

### Example 1: Saturn in 6th House

**BEFORE (Too Neutral):**
> "Saturn in the sixth house can be associated with a stronger focus on service, responsibilities, and health management, with outcomes varying based on overall chart support."

**AFTER (Truthful Seriousness):**
> "Saturn in the sixth house can create sustained pressure in health management, where throat, respiratory, and digestive health require greater attention and care. Back pain may be a recurring concern, and childhood injuries may require careful management. If unmanaged, these health areas may lead to ongoing challenges."

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Communicates specific health pressure (throat, respiratory, digestive)
- ✅ States recurring concerns (back pain, childhood injuries)
- ✅ Uses "if unmanaged, may lead to" (truthful, not fatalistic)
- ✅ Maintains capability mention (work, responsibilities)

### Example 2: Saturn in 8th House

**BEFORE (Too Vague):**
> "Saturn in the eighth house can correlate with more complex patterns around transformation and shared resources, depending on overall chart support and planetary condition."

**AFTER (Truthful Seriousness):**
> "Saturn in the eighth house can create significant health risk requiring ongoing management, where respiratory, skin, heart, digestive, and blood-related health issues may require sustained attention. Relationship dynamics with siblings and relatives can create unnecessary tension, requiring greater effort to maintain harmony. If unmanaged, health challenges may lead to ongoing difficulties."

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Communicates specific health risk areas
- ✅ States relationship pressure clearly
- ✅ Uses "if unmanaged, may lead to" (truthful consequence)
- ✅ Maintains actionable guidance (requires effort, attention)

## Refinement Checklist

For each rule, verify:

- [ ] Does it communicate pressure/risk/responsibility where the book indicates it?
- [ ] Does it avoid threatening/absolutist/fear-based language?
- [ ] Does it use "may", "can", "if unmanaged" rather than "will", "must", "always"?
- [ ] Does it provide specific life domains affected?
- [ ] Does it maintain truthful seriousness without panic?
- [ ] Does it create awareness that leads to remedy engagement?

## Systematic Refinement Process

1. **Read Original Book Text**
   - Check what challenges the book actually describes
   - Identify specific health, relationship, career, or financial pressures

2. **Assess Current Rule**
   - Is it too neutral/soft?
   - Does it miss important pressure points?
   - Does it use appropriate tone?

3. **Refine Language**
   - Add specific pressure/risk/responsibility where indicated
   - Use "may", "can", "requires", "if unmanaged"
   - Avoid "will", "must", "always", "never"

4. **Update Metadata**
   - Adjust `tone` (informational → cautionary where appropriate)
   - Adjust `intensity` (0.5 → 0.65-0.7 for significant challenges)
   - Update `trend` (mixed → down for challenging placements)

5. **Validate**
   - Does it create awareness without panic?
   - Would it motivate remedy engagement?
   - Is it truthful to the book's message?

## Priority Rules for Refinement

### High Priority (Challenging Placements):
- Saturn in 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th houses
- Mars in 6th, 8th, 12th houses
- Sun in 6th, 8th, 12th houses
- Any placement the book describes as creating health, relationship, or financial pressure

### Medium Priority (Mixed Placements):
- Saturn in other houses (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, 11th)
- Mars in challenging houses
- Other malefic placements

### Low Priority (Benefic Placements):
- Jupiter, Venus in most houses (already positive)
- Moon in supportive houses
- Mercury in neutral houses

## Final Intent

Phase 1 rules should make the user feel:

> "I understand what area of my life needs attention and why ignoring it could create problems."

This awareness is essential for remedy engagement.
